    <title>Compound proportions and Rates of work</title>
    <p>
        <m>\mathbf{Proportion}</m> is an equation that states that two ratios are equal.
         For example, if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are in the same ratio as <m>c</m> and <m>d</m>, we can write this as:
    </p>
    <p>
        It can be represented as <m>a:b = c:d</m>. This means that the fraction <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> is equal to the fraction <m>\frac{c}{d}</m>.
